=begin
Exception handling is the way errors are managed. 
By using begin, rescue, end, we anticipate and deal effectively with any possible scenarios whereby an error condition might arise or a bug introduced which otherwise might interrupt the normal flow of our program and stop it altogether. With error handling we trap/isolate the error while allowing for the rest of the program to flow normally.
